# TravelSafe

## Inspiration

We wanted to build something that help people in tourist situations or when they are in a city they are unfamiliar with.

## How I built it
Used node.js backend which handles traversal algorithm and communicates with front end which calls the Here.com API to plot the route. We get real-time Chicago crime data loaded through Google Cloud's Big Query for the purposes of testing this in one city.
